        Hi, I'm Will! I'm a senior Computer Science student at UMD. Inside of CS, I'm very interested in data science
        and machine learning, and plan to attend graudate school sometime in the future to continue my education. After graduation,
        I plan on working in consulting and currently have accepted an offer to work as an analyst at ICF International.

        I fell in love with computer science at the end of my freshman year after realizing that aerospace engineering
        was way too hard for me. I was always good at math so I wanted another way to apply those skills. 
        One night after watching Moneyball, it all clicked for me. Data analysis was the perfect way for me to combine my 
        love of numbers and problem solving. It also helped that I happen to love baseball so the movie connected with me even better.
      </p>

        In my free time, I enjoy lifting weights, hanging out with friends, and going on hikes with my dog, Hudson.
        He is a very good boy, and look at how cute he is! 

        At UMD, I'm a brother of Tau Epsilon Phi and also work as a student manager on the baseball team.
